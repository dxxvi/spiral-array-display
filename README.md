This project is for the requirement at audible. This is the requirement:

Display an n x m array as a string spirally. The array is entered from the screen or from a file.

Example: this array
  1  2  3  4  5
  6  7  8  9  10
  11 12 13 14 15
  16 17 18 19 20
will be displayed as
  1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 19 18 17 16 11 6 7 8 9 14 13 12

This example can be found on www.careercup.com. I saw one written in C this afternoon, but now careercup.com doesn't
  work (Over Quota error).

Run the application with:

mvn -Dexec.mainClass=home.Main exec:java
